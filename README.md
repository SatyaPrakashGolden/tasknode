\maketitle

\section*{Overview}
Welcome to the \textbf{TaskNode Project}, a cutting-edge and highly efficient task management system built with modern technologies. This project showcases robust user authentication, dynamic task management, and real-time updates, all while ensuring maximum security, performance, and user-friendliness. Powered by Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT for secure token-based authentication, TaskNode is engineered to handle all your task management needs with unmatched ease and precision.

The system boasts an array of features, from task creation and real-time updates to secure user authentication, task tracking, and rate limiting. TaskNode is also optimized for performance with regex-based searching and WebSocket integration for real-time updates, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

\section*{Key Features}

\subsection*{1. User Registration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a robust, secure \textbf{Sign-Up} endpoint that accepts critical user details such as \texttt{username}, \texttt{email}, and \texttt{password}, ensuring a flawless user experience.
    \item Enforced cutting-edge validation mechanisms that ensure correct \texttt{email} formatting and strong password requirements, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access.
    \item Leveraged regex patterns to verify the strength and security of passwords, allowing only the most secure password combinations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. User Login}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Created a highly flexible and secure \textbf{Login} endpoint, supporting both \texttt{username} and \texttt{email} for easy access.
    \item Integrated \texttt{bcrypt.compare()} for ultra-secure password verification, ensuring no password data is stored in plain text.
    \item Issued a secure JWT token on successful login, which is stored client-side, allowing for stateless authentication in subsequent requests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Get User Profile}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designed a highly secure endpoint for retrieving authenticated user details, including \texttt{username}, \texttt{email}, roles, and other important attributes.
    \item Implemented JWT middleware to ensure that only authorized users with valid tokens can access their personal profile.
    \item Robust user experience with clear and easy access to their data, reinforcing trust and security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Task Management}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Create Task}: Developed a comprehensive task creation endpoint, with options for \texttt{title}, \texttt{description}, \texttt{due date}, \texttt{priority}, and \texttt{status}, ensuring full control over task creation.
    \item \textbf{Read Task}: Implemented advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination functionality to retrieve tasks with precision and efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Update Task}: Enabled users to easily update task details, with automatic validation and error handling to prevent invalid task modifications.
    \item \textbf{Delete Task}: Created a safe, secure delete endpoint, ensuring tasks are only deleted when explicitly requested by authorized users.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Real-Time Updates}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrated powerful \textbf{WebSockets (Socket.io)} to provide real-time notifications, ensuring users are always updated on task changes, assignments, and status updates.
    \item Real-time updates help teams stay synchronized, improving productivity and reducing the risk of missing important updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{6. Task Tracking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced a unique \textbf{tracking number} for each task, enabling easy tracking and monitoring of task progress at all stages of the workflow.
    \item Task tracking adds a layer of transparency and accountability, ensuring tasks are completed on time and within scope.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{7. Rate Limiting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applied sophisticated rate-limiting techniques to prevent API abuse, ensuring the system remains fast and responsive for all users.
    \item Rate limiting helps prevent overuse of resources and provides fair access to all users, preventing overload or downtime.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{8. Regex Searching}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented powerful \textbf{regex-based searching} on task fields, allowing users to filter tasks based on \texttt{status}, such as \texttt{completed}, \texttt{pending}, and \texttt{overdue}.
    \item Users can quickly locate specific tasks, improving task management efficiency and user experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{9. Hosting and Deployment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The TaskNode project is fully hosted on \textbf{Vercel}, providing blazing-fast server response times and 24/7 availability.
    \item The hosting infrastructure is optimized for high scalability and performance, ensuring TaskNode can handle large volumes of users and tasks seamlessly.
\end{itemize}
